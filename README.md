# PONG GAME
This game is all about the famous game Pong. It is a redesigned and newer version which is still in progress.
Classic mode (it will still get some upgrades) can already be played - block defense mode, upside down mode and much more are following!

## Classic Mode
It's quite self-explaining since it's an easy understandable mode. You can move the paddle with your up- and down-keys and
you need to hit the ball in order to bounce it to your opponent. If you or the opponent didn't catch up and the ball hits the wall
the other one gets a point. In the pre settings you can choose the amount of points you need to have in order to win. In the pre
settings there will still be some other cool stuff added soon! Good luck and have fun!
